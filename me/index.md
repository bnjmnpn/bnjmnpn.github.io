As my Twitter bio says, I am studying for an Honours Bachelors of Arts in economics and political science at the University of Toronto.

Naturally then I live in Toronto, Canadaâ€”albeit somewhat reluctantly owing to how virtually no place on earth can compare with my hometown of Vancouver, Canada. Yes, this is a pretty unfair statement, but as the aphorism goes, "There's no place like home."

Favourite colour: black. Then again, that's not a colour, just the absence of. So... purple.

Favourite band/musician: impossible to choose. I never liked this question.

Biggest interest: I really really enjoy movies. But who doesn't?!

Key technology and gadgetry (at least, the ones I like): OSX/Windows on a 2014 13' Macbook Air, Apple Magic Mouse, Logitech MX518 mouse, HE-400 planar magnetic headphones (<3) powered by a Yulong U100 DAC/amp, JBL Creature III speakers, iPhone 5s, and Westone UM2 IEMs.

Now for the obligatory social media links: I'm on
