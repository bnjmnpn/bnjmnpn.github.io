Slated for a July 18th release, the multi-hundred million dollar Warner Brothers production *Jupiter Ascending* by all appearances aspires to be a summer blockbuster up there with other revenue generating behemoths. Unless the Wachowskis deliver a film with *Gravity* level word of mouth acclaim however, there's real potential here for a financial flop.

I love sci-fi, and I love original sci-fi universes. *Jupiter Ascending* promises to satisfy that desire, with the Wachowskis writing the story from the ground up—it is no adaptation, remake, or shameless copy of any other property.

As much as I might enjoy it then, it thus has to begin the race from the position of having precisely zero fans. No feverent fanbase, ready to queue on opening night no matter the critical reception or what the social media slash blogosphere buzz is. Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis combined still do not have the acting record or following to carry a blockbuster marketing campaign either.

It boils down to this: though the new full–length trailer contains no shortage of visual effects spectacle (and actually, some of the imagery looked imaginative in all the ways sci-fi should), *Jupiter Ascending* can't expect to coast to an easy box–office victory. If there's anything the catastrophes *John Carter* and *Cowboys & Aliens* have taught us, it's that spectacle and moderately well–liked actors can only take a movie so far.
