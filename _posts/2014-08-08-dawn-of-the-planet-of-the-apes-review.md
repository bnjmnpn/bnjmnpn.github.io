The release of a Michael Bay *Transformers* installment, delivering computer generated explosions to theatre goers across the world, is always a cue for critics and self-proclaimed critics alike to bemoan the lack of real meaning in Hollywood's summer blockbusters. *Dawn of the Planet of the Apes*, Matt Reeves's entry in a series which is fertile ground for meaningful metaphor, aspires to meet that challenge.

To be sure, the film is a surprisingly beautiful one. Weta Digital's work animating the apes around the motion capture framework of Andy Serkis and his fellow cast-members's performances is a true triumph in computer generated imagery. The direction and cinematography is equally well done, as numerous sequences throughout the movie do an expert job of visually painting the story on screen. Koba's ploy to distract human guards for instance is simply beautiful in its horror.

Is *Dawn of the Planet of the Apes* then the definitive blockbuster? It appears to check all the requisite boxes, including the one Michael Bay all but pretends doesn't exist—contains depth of message. 

On that last criterion, I'm not sure it actually does.

I will not include a spoiler alert, because it's arguably no spoiler at all to say that war between ape and man-kind breaks out by the end of the film. Along with the deliberate parallel construction of both characters and character motivations between the two groups, the nicely packaged message the film contains clearly is of the folly of war and how inevitable our flaws make it be. 

It's a brilliant message on its own, one whose timing [could not be more apt](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/17/us-palestinians-israel-idUSKBN0FI04420140717){:target="blank"}. As it is executed in the film though, the end result is the impression that in the pursuit of including a impactful message, the film itself paradoxically suffers.

There is never any pretension, even right at *t*=0, that peace would be achievable. While this *adds* an element of tension to the film—we are transfixed by the unfolding story much in the way we may be watching two runaway trains on the same track barreling towards each other—the story begins to drag when this one element begins to wear thin.

In service of this end result too, the character motivations are often weakly defined and flat. Instead of character arcs, each and every character on both sides rises little above a classic Hollywood archetype. Caesar, the wise but conflicted leader. Koba, the wise leader's hurt and violent foil. Malcolm, the hopeful and idealistic peace broker. Dreyfus, the equally prejudicial human parallel to Koba.

The simple construction of the characters leads to numerous irrational interactions between many of them throughout the story. There is a fine line between having irrationality and failure as a theme and a story which itself is nonsensical, and as a result of the lack of *character* depth and story intricacy, *Dawn of the Planet of the Apes* to its detriment veers ever so slightly towards the latter.

This is no fatal flaw to the film's blockbuster credentials, as many more a movie fail on far greater levels. Still, the overall message delivered in this blockbuster is not enough to earn *Dawn of the Planet of the Apes* certification as a big summer movie that transcends the genre as some may hope or even believe.
