Watching *Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2*, one really appreciates the absolute magic that Pixar weaves into so many of its films that evidently others cannot.

Sure *Meatballs* is not without its high points—the live food animals are some of the cutest things ever to be rendered—but in other areas it really is mediocre at best. The basic animation for one is noticeably less detailed and devoid of a natural fluidity that is the hallmark of Pixar's work. While competent, the voice overs do not stand out, especially when combined with the merely passable writing. Even the scope of the story, undeniably reminiscent of the themes expounded in *Wall-E*, simply falls far short of this high water mark. The children's story whimsy is present, but though hinted at, a wider and more powerful core is missing.

Sony Pictures Animation has produced a perfectly serviceable and indeed enjoyable children’s film. That though is all that could really be said.
