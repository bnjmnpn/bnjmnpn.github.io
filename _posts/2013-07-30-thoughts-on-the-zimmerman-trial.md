In light of today’s surprisingly personal speech from President Obama, the Zimmerman trial is again dominating the mindshare of at least all those who followed the news (as if it had ever left since the “not verdict” guilty). And from what I could draw from the President’s 18 minute address, he seems to perfectly outline what all the debate ought to actually be centred around.

He certainly offered no overt critique of the jury’s verdict, nor in my humble opinion should he have. There of course are those who would vehemently disagree with this viewpoint, but the simple fact is that American society—and dare I say, many Western societies—have constructed justice systems with the principle of minimizing the probability of a [type 1 error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_error_rate#Type_I_error) strongly in mind. Hence, from this we get the crucial goalpost of “beyond reasonable doubt”—it’s not sufficient to prove mere chance of guilt, nor even likely guilt. With this fundamental fact of how our criminal justice system works in mind, I have yet to see anything compelling which suggests the jury acted incorrectly according to Florida law. One certainly has the right to disagree with the verdict on the grounds of disagreeing with this principle, but let not such debate be construed into an accusation that the justice system has utterly failed vis-à-vis the Zimmerman trial.

Yet none of that is to say that there is not some sort of greater failing this tragic case has (rightly) brought into our collective consciousnesses. The President spoke at length about the need to view much of the African-American response through the lens of the racial problems that he himself was and is a subject of, and which still stain our ostensibly “post-racial” society today. And so, the specifics of the Zimmerman case aside, this racism that too many African-Americans are victimized by must be what we focus our attention and efforts on, and not simple and misguided cries about some alleged travesty of justice. Treyvon Martin is proof of this task’s importance.
