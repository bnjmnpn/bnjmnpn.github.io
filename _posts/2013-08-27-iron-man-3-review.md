I finally got around to watching *Iron Man 3*. I guess that’s a "first world problem" you face when traveling during the summer—you miss all those blockbusters. And whether the same happened to you, or you just couldn’t be bothered to watch Robert Downey Jr. in more Iron Man action, consider this your spoiler warning.

The second the Marvel logo animation began rolling at the beginning to the tune of "Blue", Eiffel 65’s 1999 smash hit (hey it was in Europe okay), I knew things were going to get interesting. And man was I right.

I’m not a Marvel comic junky, so I can’t really empathize with the angry mobs of those who are. I do understand that they had one of their favourite villains from the universe torn from them. Yet still, when the movie dropped the plot twist that the evil mastermind the trailers and the entire first 70% of the movie builds up to—the Mandarin—was **completely** a smokescreen, my first thought was, “What the hell is this sack of shit?!?”

"But that’s what a plot twist does!", you are now indignantly screaming. That however, in my mind, is only about 50% correct. The other half of a good twist, and really typically the source of all the fun in one, is that feeling of realizing you’ve been brilliantly played through the entire lead up. All those clues dangled in front of you, all the foreshadowing, and maybe even all those suspicions you sat on in the back of your mind, have paid off! I gotta say, didn’t really happen for me in any meaningful way.

But this brings me back to Eiffel 65’s masterpiece (/s). In one strange sense, choosing "Blue" as the opening soundtrack **was** a clue. The ridiculous twist worked in the same way that the ridiculous song worked—in most other situations the song is uncannily annoying, and yet I smiled and started chuckling and laughing the moment it began playing. This, making the sometimes ludicrous actually work and fun and funny all in a spectacular fashion, is the special ability of so many Marvel films. *Iron Man 3* executes this pretty darn well.
