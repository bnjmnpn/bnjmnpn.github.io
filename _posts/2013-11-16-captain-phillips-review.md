Assessing Paul Greengrass's depiction of the Maersk Alabama pirate takeover, *Captain Phillips*, is in several ways quite reminiscent of last year's history dramatization *Zero Dark Thirty*.

While Somali pirates hijacking a US flagged container ship and then subsequently being defeated at the hands of US military may seem slightly less compelling than the hunt for one of the most wanted individuals in history, Greengrass's entry into the genre does an admirable job of keeping up with Kathryn Bigelow's.

Such is no small feat—*Zero Dark Thirty* is a solid film, and was one of 2012's standouts. *Captain Phillips* however, delivers.

If you overlook the questionable accent, Tom Hanks provides a sharp and convincing portrayal as Captian Richard Phillips. Mix in Barkhad Abdi's powerful debut as the Somali pirate leader Muse, and you have one heck of a Hollywood production. The tension between the Captain and the would–be captain—as intoned by Muse's line, "I'm the Captain now."—and later the US Navy Captain tasked with resolving the whole affair, is a brilliant dynamic.

The film is expertly shot, with several key scenes late in the film telling the whole story through the cinematography alone. The diminutive rocking lifeboat containing the wounded Captain and his deteriorating captors under the intense and steely glare of spotlights from monstrous US Navy warships is a microcosm for the entire saga.

*Captian Phillips* then, in the same vein as *Zero Dark Thirty*, is a Hollywood movie done right: a compelling and semi–historical story, sharp acting and cinematography, and mass audience appeal.

And as the pirates met their inevitable end, one really cannot help but to empathize with their unfortunate stories. Most surprising was the film's ability to instil no small measure of [Stockholm syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome) amongst viewers. This is undoubtedly helped by the realization that the Somalis "neutralized" by the Navy SEAL snipers were real people, with real stories behind their (short–lived) lives. Young teenagers who in many ways were merely at the mercy of the world in which they lived, a world so distant from that of the Captain's and ours.
