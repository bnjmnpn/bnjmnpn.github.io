How does one review something like the eight film Harry Potter series? Certainly not with ease. But now with the benefit of a fantastic journey re-watching the entire saga (thank you Cineplex!) a sober assessment of the entire series just might be in order.

###Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone

Genesis. While I hope this was not anyone’s first glimpse at the Harry Potter universe—the books do exist of course—it nevertheless marks the beginning of our journey through the movies. How then, can the movie not hold a special place in your heart?

At least, it does for me. This is the movie that gives us all of our favourite iconic images, and establishes a universe so breathtakingly full of fantasy and whimsy. Our first look at the castle, our first look at the Great Hall, our first look at our heroes and heroines, all of it.

Sure, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and many of the actors are inexperienced and thus give quite mediocre performances, and sure it isn’t the most beautifully shot, beautifully scored, or beautifully edited. I though am more than willing to cut it some slack by virtue of it’s place in my heart.

*3.5/5*

###Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

Chris Columbus returns to direct this chapter, and thus it shouldn’t be surprising that it retains the same style and feel as its predecessor. And yet I must say that in doing so, it lacks any real improvement over the first.

My criticisms of the first apply here too, but here without the benefit of it being an iconic movie. I do not know if it’s fair to expect more, but the young children are clearly still growing into their mammoth roles, and it is evident. Columbus gives Hogwarts the same feel of whimsy as the first, but even just one movie in, it already feels lacking and childish—viewed again now in 2013, something only the first movie can be excused for.

*3/5*

###Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Oh Azkaban, how I wanted to love you. With the third, Cuarón redesigns and reimagines the Harry Potter universe—symbolized better by nothing but the changes in the castle itself. It’s a darker, more gritty style that trades the overtones of a children’s movie for a mature depiction of the world.

<div class="full">

</div>

There is a marked shift in the portrayal of our favourite characters as well—the slightly lengthier gap between this film and the preceding one worked out for the better in this regard. The increased confidence amongst virtually all the key actors is palpable, and translated very well to the screen. The unforgettable scene of Hermione mustering up an astonishing amount of heretofore unseen self-confidence and punching Draco in the face, epitomizes Emma’s growth into playing her role perfectly.

Here however I must confess that I am clouded by my views of the book. I have long felt *Azkaban* to be my least favourite of the series, and almost unavoidably this affected my impression of the film. This chapter of course does advance important plot points (the introduction of Remus and Sirius, for instance), and does contain the admittedly clever device of the time turner. In the end however, there is something lacking in the overall story.

If I had to hazard a guess as to what this may be, it would be this: through the entire story prior to the last few chapters, we are given a steady build-up of Sirius as the primary antagonist, a frightening enemy who deserves to be hated for his culpability in the deaths of Harry’s parents. Yet right at the end, it is revealed that this all was fatally misguided and really just a waste of time. No, instead Pierre Pettigrew ought to be our target! And as we all know, he is given just minutes of screen time before promptly escaping. And Sirius flies off. The end.

I can see the hate mail already, but let me just say that I could almost mistake this for an episode of *Prison Break*—there’s a certain grandeur that’s missing. And while the film itself rectified so much of what was wrong with the first two cinematically, it ultimately did not manage to have the same emotional and visceral impact as it’s successors.

As an aside, it’s somewhat disappointing that this is the first and last Harry Potter film with Cuarón at the helm. I do wonder what he could’ve delivered had he been given the more experienced actors, the more compelling stories, and the greater budgets of the rest of the films.

I would also be remiss not to comment on Michael Gambon’s portrayal of Dumbledore following Richard Harris’s sad and unfortunate death. *Azkaban* is our first look at Gambon’s Dumbledore, and while he does more than a fine job, he seems to lack a certain spark and mystery Harris imbued in the character.

*3/5*

###Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

As the old cliché goes, the plot thickens. Quite literally, in fact, if one simply considers the drastic and sudden increase in the length of the the book! This of course undoubtedly was a challenge, but newcomer Mike Newell did a respectable job of condensing the film down to a workable film length while staying true to the source material.

This and all subsequent films maintain the darker tone set by *Azkaban*, befitting the plot. For it is of course in this film that our hero finally confronts a very much alive Lord Voldemort—who Fiennes plays wonderfully. Leading up to this, the Triwizard (Quadrawizard?) Tournament is recreated in excellent detail. All three of the competitive events, along with extras like the Yule Ball, are noteworthy highlights of the film.

<div class="full">

Daniel, Rupert, and Emma continue on the theme of delivering ever better performances. With Harry, Ron, and Hermione entering adolescence, and the complex balancing act between the festivities of school, the challenges of the competition, and the increasing darkness foreshadowing both, all three actors perform admirably.

The struggle for the franchise so far however has been to deliver something truly outstanding, something that lives up to the high regard I hold the books in. Even with solid cinematography and solid acting, *Goblet of Fire* falls ever so slightly short of this lofty ideal.

*4/5*

###Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

This fifth movie debuts the fourth and final director of the series, David Yates. He could not have picked a more difficult Harry Potter film to make his debut. For here at the longest book of the series, with a relatively dense plot paradoxically containing few defining elements until its very final chapters, the film shows cracks under the weight of this burden.

Several scenes and characters were either severely trimmed or axed altogether, yet even still the plot is a jumble of events mixed together. With this lack of clear direction in the story, the film even sheds much of the magic and awe so important to a Harry Potter film.

Even with objectively competent performances from key actors, they nonetheless felt the least inspired of the series—perhaps owing to the uninspiring design of the story. An ultimately unfulfilling conclusion, punctuated only by a short but visually exciting duel between Dumbledore and Lord Voldemort within the Ministry, ends the film.

<div class="full">

</div>

What could possibly have been done to make the film work better? Truth be told, most likely very little. Astute readers will already note the omission of key elements—the greater significance and source of the prophecy as well as the Department of Mysteries itself, to name just one—and even still the script was unwieldy. Here then, we find the book most untranslatable to the big screen producing a movie with real flaws.

*3.5/5*

###Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Finally at the second-to-last book, the movies and Yates helming their production come into their own. Solid performances from key actors, including Gambon as Dumbledore, were incredibly enjoyable to watch and most welcome.

Cinematically the film is a radical improvement over its predecessors. It is often difficult to portray visually moments that exceed what is imagined by a keen reader, and yet several scenes do just that. Aragog’s surprisingly touching and emotional funeral, presided over by a fantastic Jim Broadbent as Horrace Slughorn, stands out as one of *Half-Blood Prince*'s shining moments. Harry’s first introduction to the daunting and dangerous task of hunting horcruxes, as he and Dumbledore journey to the cave, [is a spectacular sequence](http://youtu.be/ulxSNBYCgcM?t=13s).

<div class="full">

</div>

One particularly regrettable choice of the film however, is the removal of so much of Lord Voldemort’s personal story. Specifically, not including the story of his birth to a muggle father who never loved his witch mother as well as the entire Gaunt backstory robs Voldemort of an unfortunate amount of depth and complexity. We lose an important glimpse into his motivations and an understanding of just how horrifically dark his world really is.

*4.5/5*

###Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1

The beginning of the end. And what a beginning! This is perhaps the film with one of the least overt magic—during several segments, you’d be forgiven for forgetting this was even a Harry Potter movie. This is also perhaps the film with the lowest amount of screen time for auxiliary characters—the brunt of the film focuses on the journey of our trio alone, and in one memorable chapter only Harry and Hermione. Yet as this is the film where the three truly first entire the “Special World” or the “Unknown” in the classical Hero’s Journey, this focus is fitting.

<div class="full">

</div>

One would reason then that a film devoid of all that previously made Harry Potter such a treat to watch would utterly fall flat on its face. The movie though is far from a disaster, and instead proves to be an incredible journey for any Harry Potter fan. Here it is worth noting that one’s enjoyment of this film will probably correlate with how invested you are in the main three characters, but being devotedly invested is by no means a requirement.

The three actors deliver simply outstanding performances, easily the most powerful of the whole eight movie series. And now in hindsight, the decision to split the seventh book into two movies was simply genius. Here in *Part 1*, we are treated to an extraordinary glimpse into the minds of the characters and their friendship, and more compellingly the toll their quest is taking.

It is clear that all three of them have come to embody their roles, and have truly taken on their respective characters. We the audience are no longer watching three actors’ depictions of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but instead are given an window into their lives and their world. Moving and intimate scenes, combined with this heartfelt acting, complete the picture.

</div>

Visually and stylistically the film is a treat, with stunning vistas of the travels through the British countryside. Most importantly, the added length enabled by a two-part movie allows no element from the source to be left out. Even ancillary segments are rendered in loving detail---the fairytale of the Three Brothers from Tales from Beedle the Bard unexpectedly is told in the form of a mesmerizingly beautiful animation.

*5/5*

###Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2

And with all that, this is the end. The end of an incredible saga, the incredible and fantastical tale of Harry Potter and his friends.

*Part 2* delivers on this promise of a proper and fitting finale to this 10 year adventure. Filmed in tandem with *Part 1*, it picks up precisely where the previous leaves off. And in this sense, it is its perfect complement. For while the previous part was very much a “solitary” tale of the our heroes and them alone, this film encompasses every single character dear to the universe.

<div class="full">
![Neville](/images/2013/neville.jpg)
</div>

Our favourite members of the supporting cast are each given his or her moment in the spotlight, to great effect. With this being our last look at all of them, naturally we can expect no less from a movie tasked with concluding it all. Professors McGonagall’s and Snape’s duel, Professor Snape’s final moments, crowd-favourite Neville Longbottom’s triumphant speech, the entirety of these little scenes from the book are reproduced brilliantly.

The climax of the movie, and I daresay of the entire series, is of course the final battle at Hogwarts. This epic finale, the ultimate confrontation between the two opposing sides is a spectacle in every sense of the word. After all these years waiting for this moment, nothing short of a spectacle would’ve sufficed.

*5/5*

###The Final Verdict

I have always believed that one of the true pieces of genius in the Toy Story series is the way the movies matured and grew as the audience itself, going from first movie to the third, did. The target age group for each of the three was more or less the same age as Andy. If you fitted in this group as I did, the effect was truly touching.

Over the course of these eight films, Harry Potter at the very least deserves partial credit for accomplishing the same.

I believe the final measure of how successful these films are lies in the answer to the simple question, do they live up to the books? Taken one movie at a time, the answer is unclear. Upon viewing them all again however, over the course of one summer, the only answer I can come up with is, yes they do.
