Once upon a time, going to watch an IMAX film at the now defunct Canada Place CN IMAX was an occasion. As their slogan boasts, one absolutely needed to see IMAX in person to believe it. The 70mm film projected onto a mammoth 1.43:1 screen combined with an unbelievably powerful 5.1 audio system produced an experience rivalled by *nothing*, never mind a theatre at your typical multiplex of the day.

IMAX undoubtedly is more profitable and successful than ever as a business. After viewing *The Hunger Games: Catching Fire* at the Toronto Scotiabank Digital IMAX theatre this week however, with a critical eye to picture and audio quality, I had but one saying on my mind: "Oh how the mighty have fallen."

Of course as anyone who's watched an IMAX film in North America (excluding at your local science museum) is well aware, the old 70mm format has largely been relegated to history. Yet this is not a case of the forward march of technology, as the experience at the CN IMAX still would be competitive with the theatres of today. Instead Digital IMAX today, shown in the same buildings as the lowly 35mm standard theatre, bears no resemblance to its roots. It has undoubtedly been downgraded for mass marketability and compatibility to cinema owners and studios.

Gone are the gigantic 70mm projectors, replaced with dual 2K Christie DLP projectors. Gone are the entire buildings built around a towering screen, instead replaced with traditional theatres retrofitted with slightly larger and much closer to the audience screens. Here it needs to be said that, unlike the video side of the coin, the 5.1 audio configuration of old appears to have largely survived.

Though I call Digital IMAX a downgrade and though anyone who has seen "real" IMAX will describe it as a worse experience, it is by all means a technologically competent system. IMAX it seems however has not noticed that it is no longer competing with the 35mm theatres it usually neighbours.

With full 1080p AMOLED displays in our mobile phones, cinema owners are now more than ever cognizant of the viewing public's demand for presentation quality while paying to see a movie. With clever mixes of cinema technology available on the market right now, these operators no longer have to rely on IMAX to deliver these upgraded experiences. AMC has their ETX line of theatres, and Cineplex its UltraAVX. I have no experience with the former and extensive with the latter of these, and so I will only speak to UltraAVX.

Digital IMAX's opening introduction claims it to be "The Ultimate Movie Experience", and it may still may be right in terms of visuals. The dual 2K projectors provide excellent contrast in addition to an adequately detailed image, easily trading blows and matching if not beating UltraAVX's standard single 2K and in many cases 4K Christie projectors. The lower resolution (two times 2K projection does not 4K make) however is noticeable, especially if one is sitting in a seat closer to the screen. IMAX though unprecedentedly is [exploring 4K *laser* projection](http://variety.com/2013/film/news/imax-demos-new-laser-technology-to-mostly-bright-reception-1200856572/), and so may yet retake the indisputable picture lead.

Still in this respect, for me on Tuesday night at Scotiabank Theatre Toronto, IMAX may have been a victim of its own success. Its newfound adaptability and flexibility---through its compromise in what sort of screen and room still qualifies as an "IMAX" experience---has allowed operators to retrofit their traditional theatres. Some have done a good job (Cineplex's Empress Walk is acceptable) while others have crammed the larger and closer screen in rooms that are simply not spacious enough. My seat was far from in the infamous first two or three rows, and yet there was an undeniably claustrophobic sensation from  how physically close the screen's surface was.

IMAX designed it as such in a bid to emulate the former big--screen glory of its 70mm years. Of course after all, a smaller screen closer to the viewer is perceived to be larger! With its lower 2K resolution, its seemingly overly close nature (at least from the first 1/4 rows of seats), and the lack of a greater vertical field of view the much taller 70mm theatres offered, this all resulted in a worse picture experience for myself watching *Catching Fire* both compared to "real" IMAX and even UltraAVX.

Interestingly from a business perspective, one would think that operators like Cineplex would be incentivized to retrofit their better theatre rooms for their own enhanced formats as opposed to an IMAX theatre, thus saving on what must be substantial revenue sharing costs while still charging a premium over regular tickets. From this perspective, IMAX's greatest asset is but its brand recognition.

![Dolby Atmos](/images/2013/Dolby_Atmos.jpg)

When I bought an IMAX instead of an UltraAVX ticket though, I was also sacrificing Dolby's new [Atmos](http://www.dolby.com/us/en/consumer/technology/movie/dolby-atmos.html) platform in favour of IMAX's proprietary 5.1 setup.

Unlike for the picture, audio quality is an area were UltraAVX in combination with Atmos soundly trumps IMAX. A well mastered and mixed film like Alfonso Cuarón's masterpiece *Gravity* demonstrates the astounding soundstage Atmos can deliver. In perfect harmony with the utter lack of distinction between up and down in space, *Gravity* has audio and specific sounds that float, pan, and rotate about in the theatre. It doing so with such agility and precision was made possible by Atmos's object--based---versus traditional 5.1 and IMAX's channel based---processing that allows for addressing each speaker or array *individually*.

![IMAX Comparison](/images/2013/imax_comparison.jpg)

If one considers IMAX's promotional material, the company evidently still only thinks it is competing with traditional 5.1. IMAX's implementation unsurprisingly is absolutely superior to any other implementation of five discrete channels plus one LFE channel.

Yet Dolby or DTS 5.1 is far more common now in the *home* theatre, with cinemas already having moved on to 7.1 setups. Now with object--based platforms like Atmos or even expanded channel--based systems like [Barco's Auro 11.1](http://www.barco.com/en/auro11-1), to watch IMAX is to miss out on the cutting edge of audio technology. With Atmos at least, having never been to an Auro equipped theatre, the increased spatial resolution and immersion provided by the improved processing and the overhead speakers is easily worth the price of admission.

None of any of that is to say that modern IMAX is a generally and unconditionally poor experience. In the face of stiff competition and without a *unique* product the way its 70mm theatres were however, the company's and its theatre product's place in the market has shifted substantially. Its investor and cinema operator friendly success sits opposed to its original goal of uncompromisingly delivering the best movie experience possible.

No longer an experience unto itself, IMAX's evolution has resulted in a very real retreat from the company's motto of "IMAX is Believing".
