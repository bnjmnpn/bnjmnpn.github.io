excerpt: "It's not often that a video game cinematic of any kind, cutscene or trailer, measures up to even an even average sequence out of an unremarkable Hollywood film. Questionable voice acting, forgettable and pointless music (if there even is any), and bizarre editing are all too common."

The Witcher 3's opening cinematic shows how it's done: engaging and dynamic camera movement and placement, composition that actually shows thought put in, fitting music, and smart editing.
