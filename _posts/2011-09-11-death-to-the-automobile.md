I was browsing through some blog posts and comments about the Port Mann Bridge and Highway 1 infrastructure upgrades in Vancouver, and noticed an interesting argument that seemed to be woven into virtually all of them. Or if you are [this](http://www.2020vancouver.com/node/46) blogger, stated directly:

> "… there’s no place for massive road infrastructure projects in a future with peak oil and climate change… So residents of East Vancouver and Burnaby can look forward to more cars, more congestion, more noise, and more pollution, as if it wasn’t bad enough already."

More congestion and more noise, that would probably be inevitable given more cars entering the city. From my own driving experience though, I would rather there be generally more cars spread out on the city’s roads than all bottlenecked at one critical point. But yes, I concede that to be a very valid concern. There’s something odd about the other part of the argument though, one assumption that very well may prove to be flawed. The premise is that the automobile is inherently reliant on oil, and is inherently polluting and detrimental to the environment. Once stated like that however, I am genuinely surprised more people haven’t challenged it.

Would the advent of an automobile which was truly emissions free, able to be built and run sustainably (and purchased affordably) be the death of a sizeable part of today’s environmental movement?

Campaigns that target increased bicycle or transit use are definitely commendable given the state of today’s cars and their terrible impact on the environment, but an almost utopian future where we could have the personal mobility of cars without destroying our planet would render these superfluous.

Don’t get me wrong, I love transit as much as the next person. Actually, strike that—I would argue I love transit far more than the average person. There is something marvellous about a well–oiled system, with its meticulously planned and executed routes—the wonders that are the complex rapid mass–transit systems of today’s metropolises. Indeed, no matter where I am, there is a certain fun in seeing how each city handles transport for the masses. Be it riding the rails of Hong Kong’s absolutely brilliant MTR or just heading to downtown Vancouver on one of Translink’s very attractive diesel–hybrid busses (or on the Expo or Millennium Lines’ MK II trains, those things are a joy to ride), I love the experience, and when it works, I love the pure efficiency at which it all happens! Call me odd, but even hearing the voice announcers calling out stop names, or in Hong Kong’s case, announcing the imminent closing of the subway train’s doors in three languages, is somehow quite satisfying. And to all those who incessantly complain about Translink’s service—spend a week with transit in Beijing (actually, even in Toronto!) and you, like I, will truly then appreciate the job they’re doing. While it may not be the best, it is far far from the abhorrent worst some like to paint it as. But I digress.

My point with this is, even I, given the choice between an automobile without it’s environmental consequences and a well–run transit system, would still have a hard time giving the former up for the latter. The car isn’t just about giving personal mobility, it is personal in the truest sense of that word. The driver is not at the mercy of a (even occasional) late bus, or bus routes that just happen to not be able to take you to your destination with fewer than three transfers, or an overcrowded and stifling subway carriage (which it almost always is at rush hour no matter which city you’re in unless apparently it starts with Hong and rhymes with Kong), or the weather who just happens to decide that a torrential downpour will commence the moment you realize you’ve forgotten to pack an umbrella for the walk between the bus stop and school (true story).

So, as we move ever closer to an emissions free future for cars, will projects like the new Port Mann no longer be described as “monstrosities” and vilified any more than a large mass-transit project? Will [this](http://twitpic.com/2widej) slogan no longer be true? (I’m assuming they mean the verb “Building freeways = climate crime”) Will they even be (gasp) welcomed? Somehow, I suspect that they won’t, given that there are those who oppose such things more because of an inexplicable idealogical hatred, or who are just more interested in politicking. I apologize profusely if I got a bit too “Fox News” just there.
