I have yet to read Orson Scott Card's *Ender's Game*, nor the subsequent books in its universe. Considering the place in science--fiction literature these books hold, it's not surprising to have a certain level of expectation for the film adaptation.

The story of *Ender's Game* is a story of the tribulations the children are knowingly and unknowingly subjected to, in the name of the fighting an alien species. It is a story of adults and those with authority, and specifically with Colonel Graff very much as a father figure for the young Ender, deferring the sins of warfare onto these young cadets. All this accomplished through one of the greatest ruses I have encountered in fiction—the reveal that the simulation is anything but a simulation is a moment that cries for serious contemplation.

Yet it does serve as a bit of a letdown as well. As the pace of the movie quickens, foreshadowing aside, we are overtly told time and time again that all the events are a precursor to the climatic battle to end all wars. The final battle itself is no slouch in the visual excitement department, though again we are reminded that a yet greater and final battle lies just ahead. We sit with trepidation through the already exciting "simulation", only to have cold water doused on this excitement with the reveal that this indeed was said battle. Such a complete anticlimactic plot twist is incredibly difficult to pull off while still leaving a sense of fulfillment, and *Ender's Game* falls short here.

It does not help that both in the crescendo of tension leading up to the pivotal battle and in its aftermath, we are given the smallest of windows into Ender's (and the other children's) minds. Ender from outward actions appears to be on the verge of breaking, and yet save for the emails to his sister and perhaps the crucial fight with Bonzo, the true trauma and conflict within him is very much left to our imagination.

This very sacrifice of Ender's inner self by those older and wiser, and to use Graff's words, those who "own" Ender as a child of their creation, is the very centre of the story itself. With so little insight into the effect of the sins of these fathers on Ender, the film lets this profound strand of thought fall through its grasp.
