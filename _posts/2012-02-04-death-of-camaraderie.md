I really took it for granted. All throughout high school, it just seemed like such a natural part of everyday (student) life that I did not pay the slightest attention to it at all. Yet the moment I walked into my first university lecture, reality hit me with the impact of a solid brick wall: it was dead.

What then, had died? This is not another (typical?) rant from a former high–schooler lamenting the loss of free time as a result of tougher university courses, or the far more rigorous requirements. On the contrary, the challenge of harder courses ultimately feels rather rewarding, or at the very least, ought to. No, what had died was something that appears to be increasingly rare, and perhaps far more complex: a true sense of camaraderie.

And really this is not a sentiment that is easily articulated. Why is this a consequence of leaving high–school? Does this not exist in university as well (classmates or sports teams, etc.)? And would it not exist hypothetically in the future, at the workplace for instance? Alas at least based on my past experience, the unfortunate answer is no.

Sure you have classmates in your university classes just as you do in high–school, yet the overwhelming feeling is that there is something far deeper at play here. Given the large class sizes that are the staple of today’s university education system, it is unsurprising that it is virtually impossible to be friends with each and every classmate. That is not to say that one cannot have friends within the class, but owing to the sheer volume of students, it is inevitable that one feels like a far smaller part of the jigsaw puzzle than would be the case in high–school. The issue is not limited to simple perceived insignificance (though this is a large part for sure). More importantly, it is the loss of a sense of mutual kinship and fraternity amongst all classmates that saddens me the most.

Perhaps this is just something unique to my high–school career, but at least for myself, I recall vividly such bonds existing. Now even in far smaller classes, I could never claim to be friends with everyone. I sincerely doubt I am unusual in this regard. Yet even with this being the case, just sitting in class, I had a strong sense that everyone around was “in it together”, that everyone seemed to have a stake in each other’s success. In a sense then, while we were not all friends, classes often felt like a large gathering of the closest friends.

This was not something limited to academic life, to the classroom, either. Far from it. This feeling was true whenever there was a large gathering of the entire class anywhere—field trips as just one instance. In retrospect, they were indeed amazing moments. I daresay I will never enjoy an opera as much as when the entire class went to see the Vancouver Opera’s excellent rendition of Carmen. Nor will I ever have as much fun seeing an absolutely awful show, as when we went to see *show name deleted for politeness*. What is clear now, is that fun had nothing to do with the show itself—it came instead from the fact that we were all, not just amongst friends, but as an entire class, sharing the show and sharing the moment (amazing or otherwise).

If you’re still scratching your head wondering what on earth I’m talking about, I’m afraid I can’t think of any other way to describe my feelings concretely. However if you have had the same experience as myself, I hope you are slowly nodding, perhaps even reliving the exact same feeling I am describing.

Regardless, I shall attempt to provide one more example to hopefully clarify and illuminate: graduation. I admit I have no clue what university graduation is like first–hand, having not graduated myself (being but halfway through first year). Even so, I am willing to gamble anything that it will completely pale in comparison to those last glorious weeks of high–school, around prom and graduation. The weather was brilliant June sunshine, the Canucks were playing in the Stanley Cup finals, and most importantly, we were graduating! As the whole class shuffled into the auditorium, gazing up at the magnificent lighting on the ceiling of the Chan Centre, there was a palpable collective sense of accomplishment, celebration, and closure. And it was undoubtedly a collective one, that much was clear, as we listened to the valedictorian address, or when we ultimately tossed our caps into the air after being pronounced the “Class of 2011”. The spotlight then, was not on our individual selves, but the class as a whole.

A repeat of such emotions in four years, unfortunately, feels far beyond the realm of possibility. Nor does it appear probable that there will be a repeat in the workplace. True, among a group of workers and/or friends, there will inevitably exist something similar. Yet it will not be on the scale that it did in high–school, no matter the best efforts of management to foster such feelings with endless corporate outings and workshops. The fact that companies even bother with these efforts too, only serve to emphasize the appeal of having such bonds.

Perhaps then, this is the crux of the issue. Scale. The sheer awesomeness that comes from having emotions that are usually limited to between extraordinarily close friends extend to an entire peer group. No matter the cause, I fear… nay, I am almost positive, that it is ultimately irrelevant: such fraternity and camaraderie is but a remnant of the past, something to reminisce about. That much was clear to me as I settled into my spot in the lecture hall that first day of university.
